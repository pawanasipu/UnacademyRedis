1. Why did you choose that language ?
-->(I) The main reason why I choose c++ for     implementation is STL(Standrad Template Library). STL eases a user to write code in a simple and efficient manner. I used concepts like map, vector while implementation the functions
-->(II) It is widely used langugae in competative progrramers (I am an active participant) 

2. What are the further improvements that can be made to make it efficient ?
-->(I) Let's first talk about the flaws in the code, given code does not work if key is list or set or hash or hyperloglog or stream. And the given code's time complexity is more than the actutal redis functions
-->(II) Still now, I didn't get any idea for it's futher improvements

3. What data structures have you used and why?
-->(I) I particulary used C++ STL's map and vector which made things easier. We can implement map in c++ using AVL tree also

4. Does your implementation support multi threaded operations? If No why canâ€™t it be? If yes then how ?
-->(I) Yes, It supports multi threading. If we use "WINAPI" in c++ and a function named "GetCurrentThreadId", which produces a separate id.
