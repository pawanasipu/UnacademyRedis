1. Why did you choose that language?
-->(I) The main reason why I choose c++ for implementation is STL(Standard Template Library).
STL eases a user to write code in a simple and efficient manner. I used concepts like a map, 
vector while implementation of the functions
-->(II) It is widely used language in competitive programmers (I am an active participant) 

2. What are the further improvements that can be made to make it efficient?
-->(I) Let's first talk about the flaws in the code, given code does not work if the key is a list 
or set or hash or hyperloglog or stream. And the given code's time complexity is more than 
the actual Redis functions
-->(II) Still now, I didn't get any idea for its further improvements

3. What data structures have you used and why?
-->(I) I particularly used C++ STL's map and vector which made things easier. We can implement 
map in c++ using AVL tree also

4. Do your implementation support multi-threaded operations? If No why canâ€™t it be? If yes then how?
-->(I) Yes, It supports multi-threading. If we use "WINAPI" in c++ and a function named 
"GetCurrentThreadId", which produces a separate id.
